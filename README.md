# README-generator  


### Description  
This project was difficult for me, initially, but I was able to overcome my obstacles with help from a fellow classmate, Hank Holmes. This README-generator is designed to ease the process of creating a README by providing prompts which can be answered in the command terminal. The answers to those prompts are then automatically placed in a readme layout for a more professional look. With the help of this program, my READMEs will certainly become neater compared to other READMEs that I have done, and allow me to use my time to work on code for my apps.
